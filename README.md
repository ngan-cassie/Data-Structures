## Description of SIMPLE 0

### How to run the program
- Run on the terminal: “java Simple0 [test  file name]” (e.g. “java Simple0 test1.txt”)
- Test 1’s result: crash —> output: “Your program is crashed” and throws an exception. 
- Test 2’s result: -72 (supposed to be 100 + 30 = 130 but it’s an overflow for the byte type. Hence, the result is 130 % -128 = -126)

## Problems
- None so far. # Data-Structures
